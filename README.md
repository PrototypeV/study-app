## Description of Website

The purpose of this website is to provide a simple and bare study application. There are five features that the user can pick from:

- A calender that the user can put in appointments, deadlines or test dates
- Flashcards to help study and retain information
- A timer to keep track of time
- A notes session where users can upload notes
- A text to speech for auditory learners

## Tools/Languages Used in this Project

The website was created using  `HTML`, `CSS`, `Javascript`, `Typescript`, `Node.js`, `Vite`, `React`, `React-Router-Dom` and `React Bootstrap`.

## Explatation of Files

There are two folders. One for reuseable components and the other for web pages. The `App.tsx` file is where all the pages and their respective components get imported. `App.css` is the styling sheet for everything in the website. `main.tsx` is where the app gets called and rendered by react-dom.
